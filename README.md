## About the Project
I built this because, well, I myself was curious how exactly those algorithms work 🤷‍♀️

I know you too are not satisfied with the <i>"Levenshtein Distance is the minimum number of edits required to change one word into the other"</i> 😌

So, roll up your sleeves, type in your strings, and see it with your own eyes!
